![Kustomize Build](https://github.com/tinycloud-labs/flux/actions/workflows/kustomize-build.yml/badge.svg) 

Managed K8s deployment with FluxCD using an app-centric base/overlay structure. Bases and overlays are defined per application to keep deployments easy to reason about. There're some intentional non-DRY configuration to favor clarity and locality over abstraction (e.g. when working on `apps/foo/` configs, I don't want to jump between directories or mentally reconstruct how everything is wired together). Plus a[ GitHub Action runs](https://github.com/tinycloud-labs/flux/blob/main/.github/workflows/kustomize-build.yml) `kustomize build` on PRs to catch rendering issues early.

### Apps are reusable (not env aware)
```

### Clusters call the needed releases
```
clusters/
└── prod/
    ├── flux-system/
    └── apps/
        ├── kustomization.yaml     # calls the apps from /apps
        └── common-patch.yaml      # applies cluster-specific params
